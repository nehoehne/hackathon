# Notwe Tanks
This was our project for a 12-hour hackathon. It's a version of Wii Tanks but with a twist. Each player has limited ammo and if you miss a shot, your opponent gets your shell. Basically dodge ball rules. We learned a lot, had a great time, and ended up winning one of the prizes. 

## The Team 
* Kalen Arendt, team Sensei (GitHub: Kalen Arendt) 
* Edmond Wong, the other guy who knew what he was doing (GitHub: wonge1)
* Nolan Plett, game inventor (GitHub: nolanplett)
* Kevin Derkson, sound effects engineer (GitHub: 123kevyd)
* Nathan Hoehne, team administrator (GitHub: nehoehne)

## What We Learned
* How to have a killer time coding with friends
* Most of us hadn't used Unity before but Kalen was an excellent teacher and we were all able to contribute something 
* Using Git and technical communication in a fast-paced, collaborative environment

## Usage
Download the repo and run the project in Unity (Unity version: 2021.3.19f1 LTS).
